#+title: To-Do List

* Before First Release
** TODO When rendering colors directly via `ask`, don't use color codes on Windows
** TODO Use TERMINFO to figure out if we can use rgb colors
** TODO Downgrade full rgb colors to the default terminal colors
** TODO Restore exception safety in `runByline` and `withCompletionFunc`
   - I'm not using `runInputT` anymore so we don't get MonadException either
** DONE Don't loop (in `askUntil`) if running in non-interactive (file) mode
   CLOSED: [2015-05-14 Thu 17:00]
** DONE `askWithMenuRepeatedly` should do the right thing if reading from a file
   CLOSED: [2015-05-14 Thu 17:01]
** DONE Put the `askUntil` confirmation function into the `Byline m a` monad
   CLOSED: [2015-05-14 Thu 17:11]
** DONE Restore the ability to change the completion function
   CLOSED: [2015-05-14 Thu 15:23]
** DONE Simplify the interface by aborting on EOF
   CLOSED: [2015-05-14 Thu 16:27]
** DONE Remove `MonadException` from the interface
